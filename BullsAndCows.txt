The numerical version of the game is usually played with 4 digits.The game may be played by single player vs computer or by  two players.

On a sheet of paper, the players each write a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different.
The number can not starts with zero. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches.
If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows".
Example:
Secret number: 4271
Opponent's try: 1234
Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)
The first one to reveal the other's secret number wins the game.
As the first player has a logical advantage, the game can be balanced over multiple games by alternating the right to go first,
or over a single game by granting the second player an equal number of guesses, possibly resulting in a tie.
